# INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICAL LEARNING WITH PYTHON

## 1. Introduction

In this project, we can see the exercises from the book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com) but in this case, in python.

## 2. Steps to start

### 1. Create environment

This command will create a new environment with all the packages required

```bash
conda env create -f .\environment.yml
```

This command will activate the new environment when it's been created before

```bash
conda activate statistical_learning
```

### 2. Execute download_data

When you execute the 'download_data' script, this will download all the data resources to use in the rest of the scripts

```bash
python .\statistical_learning\resources\download_resources.py
```

### 3. Run

When we have the environment and the resources, we only have to run the notebooks
